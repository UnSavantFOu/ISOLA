## Presentation
This program is a little two players game I had to program in python in computer class. Itâ€™s based on a board game with the same name. The players will each in turn move from one square around them that is free (diagonal, line or column) and condemn another. The game takes place on a 7x10 grid. The goal is to block your opponent.

## Comments
This program is quite fluid, but it is based on TKinter which is limited graphically, but on the contrary the esthetic is quite clean. The event part is instead a little tinkered.

## Conclusion
To conclude, it was just a program to discover TKinter environment and its event part.
